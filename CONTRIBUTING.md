CONTRIBUTING
============

All contributions which will be beneficial to the community are welcome!

We do reserve the right to reject changes that we feel will not benefit users or take the project in a direction we do not wish to take. 
We recommend discussing any large changes with us prior to making your changes, you can do this via an issue or email if you prefer.


Issues
------

Issues should include a title and clear description with as much relevant information as possible.

If you think you have identified a security vulnerability, please reach out to the author directly (details in composer.json).


Submitting Changes
------------------

Before submitting your [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests),
please make sure that the coding standards are respected and that all tests are passing. 

Pull requests should provide an overview of the changes made so it is clear what you are trying to achieve, this will help us when reviewing your changes.

Commit messages should be clear, we don't mind one-line messages for small changes 
but larger changes should follow [The Seven Rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) set by Chris Beams. 

We don't mind squashing small changes to tidy things up but please don't squash an entire branch as this can hinder code reviews.
